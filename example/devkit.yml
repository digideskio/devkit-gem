# devkit.yml
#
# This file provides information about the compiler toolchain (DevKit)
# required by this version of Ruby.
#
# The correct location of this file will be at the root of your Ruby
# installation (at the same level as bin and lib directories).
#
# It contains extra information, like name of executables
# (CC, CXX, CPP and MAKE) used during the compilation of extensions.
#
# A list of paths is provided to indicate where those executables might be
# found.
#
# Those combined will be used as probes during DevKit detection.
